AFLDB-ISSUE-187..192 were opened 2026-09-15 from the Fable NL Search Stage 1 review (Fable 5.1,
medium effort), re-verified by Stage 2 on main `8a0c4cb`. Subsystem: natural-language search
(`src/search/nl/`, `src/db/queries/nl/`). AFLDB-ISSUE-190 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5);
AFLDB-ISSUE-188 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5); AFLDB-ISSUE-187 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5);
AFLDB-ISSUE-189 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5, from the approved runbook, operator-validated);
AFLDB-ISSUE-191 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5, operator-validated); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-193 (opened 2026-09-15 during ISSUE-189 planning) resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5,
operator-validated); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-192 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5, operator-validated: 31/31 integration tests,
5/5 ISSUE-192 regression tests, clean `tsc --noEmit`); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-187..193 all remain resolved; the Stage 2 closeout audit (2026-09-16, Sonnet 5 High)
found three neighbouring, unrelated defects while verifying the resolved fixes and opened
AFLDB-ISSUE-194..196. AFLDB-ISSUE-196 resolved 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5 High, from the approved
runbook — one runbook correction to the `across` regression contract mid-implementation, see
`issues.md` — operator-validated: 389/389 `nl-parser.test.ts`, 167/167 `nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts`,
clean `tsc --noEmit`). AFLDB-ISSUE-195 resolved 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5 High, from the approved runbook
`AFLDB-ISSUE-195.md`, Option B — subject-gated "won the/a premiership" vocabulary plus a narrow
club-season ownership guard, no runbook correction needed — operator-validated: 398/398
`nl-parser.test.ts`, 167/167 `nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts`, clean `tsc --noEmit`); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-194 resolved 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5 Medium, `sonnet/issue-194-team-match-symmetric-matchup`,
unmerged — operator-validated: 34/34 `tests/integration/nl-answers-team-club.test.ts`, clean
`tsc --noEmit`); see `issues.md`. AFLDB-ISSUE-187..196 all now resolved. The Stage 2 corpus triage
of the 208 `AMBIGUITY_NOT_DETECTED` rows (2026-09-16) classified 40 as `GENUINE_FAIL_OPEN`, 168 as
`STALE_CORPUS_EXPECTATION`, and opened AFLDB-ISSUE-197 for the 40 (one root cause).
**AFLDB-ISSUE-197 resolved 2026-09-16** (Sonnet 5, from the approved runbook `AFLDB-ISSUE-197.md` —
Option C, a dedicated `resolvePlayerFamily` resolver mirroring the parser's whole-word-prefix
predicate in SQL; `PARSER_VERSION` 48 → 49; operator-validated: 25/25
`tests/integration/nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts`, 951/951 across the full focused NL suite set,
clean `tsc --noEmit` — see `issues.md` for the full Implementation/Validation/Resolution record,
including one mid-session fixture correction and one integration-path control-flow investigation
that concluded fixture defect, not production defect). AFLDB-ISSUE-187..197 all now resolved.

Stage 2 status: **no longer blocked, but not yet fully closed out.** ISSUE-197 resolving the one
genuine fail-open root cause clears the blocker; the corpus relabelling that follows from it, and
the rest of the Stage 2 closeout sequence below, are still outstanding.

Full entries, evidence, root causes and acceptance criteria are in `issues.md`.

## Stage 2 next task (not yet started)

1. Re-run the V1 regression corpus against parser v49 (parse-only).
2. Compare the fresh run's semantic rows against the retained `~/nl-stress-v46` / v48 baseline,
   row-by-row.
3. Corpus expectation cleanup for the ISSUE-197-affected rows: the 35 generic-surname
   (Johnson/Brown/Smith/Williams/Jones/Wilson/Anderson) rows stay expected declines and should now
   pass clean; the 5 Ablett rows relabel from expected-decline to expected successful ranking across
   the complete 7-player family. Separately, the 168 stale team-streak/coach-record rows get their
   own expectation correction (unrelated to ISSUE-197's root cause, a distinct stale-corpus issue).
4. A fresh exploratory stress sweep to identify any remaining NL coverage/safety gaps beyond this
   triage.

Do not alter the corpus before that dedicated session runs it.

Completed issue runbooks and supporting evidence are archived under `issues/closed/`.
