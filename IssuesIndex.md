- **AFLDB-ISSUE-204** — Low severity, NL search stress corpus (`tools/nl/`, corpus-only, no runtime
  code implicated). Retargeted 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5) after the first operator validation run failed
  closed as designed: the original category+equivalence-group-template-only candidate selector matched
  996 real-corpus rows, not 180 (636 `team_match`-grain rows + 180 goals/top-5 `player_game` rows are
  legitimate non-targets sharing the same `fgf` template). Guarded V3→V4 correction tool
  (`tools/nl/fix-issue-204-stale-coverage-expectations.ts`) and tests
  (`tests/nl-issue-204-corpus-fix.test.ts`) now gate candidacy on the row's full structural signature
  (grain=player_game, mode=single, aggregation=max, metric in disposals/marks/tackles, match_type in
  final/grand_final, season in 1897-1926 — see `AFLDB-ISSUE-204.md` §0a/§5), not a hardcoded id list (a
  later 3-block id sample the operator quoted has no constant inter-season stride and could not be
  extended to 180 without guessing). The second operator run confirmed this targeting on the real
  corpus (reached row 8919) then exposed an unrelated correction-tool bug: `assertQuestionMatchesRow`'s
  plain-finals check was singular-only (`/\bfinal\b/i`) and rejected the corpus's plural "...in finals
  in YEAR" wording; now `/\bfinals?\b/i` (§0b). Next action: operator runs `AFLDB-ISSUE-204.md` §8's
  commands (focused tests, `tsc --noEmit`, the real V3→V4 correction with both fixes in place,
  parser-v53 rerun against V4, before/after row comparison).

AFLDB-ISSUE-202 (GWS club identity leaks into unsupported-term detection) resolved 2026-09-16
(Sonnet 5, operator-validated) -- see `issues.md` for the full record, including the additional 72
grain-equivalent GWS player-season rows normalized as a byproduct of the same fix.

AFLDB-ISSUE-203 (numeric word "zero" not bound as equality in `player_career` conditions) resolved
2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5, operator-validated) -- root cause was two cooperating gaps in
`extractCareerConditions` (missing `zero` vocabulary entry, and a comparator default wrong for a
bound zero); `PARSER_VERSION` 52→53; 15 zero-word soft findings cleared, 0 new soft rows, 0
semantic changes among the 250 remaining soft rows -- see `issues.md` for the full record.

AFLDB-ISSUE-187..192 were opened 2026-09-15 from the Fable NL Search Stage 1 review (Fable 5.1,
medium effort), re-verified by Stage 2 on main `8a0c4cb`. Subsystem: natural-language search
(`src/search/nl/`, `src/db/queries/nl/`). AFLDB-ISSUE-190 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5);
AFLDB-ISSUE-188 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5); AFLDB-ISSUE-187 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5);
AFLDB-ISSUE-189 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5, from the approved runbook, operator-validated);
AFLDB-ISSUE-191 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5, operator-validated); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-193 (opened 2026-09-15 during ISSUE-189 planning) resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5,
operator-validated); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-192 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5, operator-validated: 31/31 integration tests,
5/5 ISSUE-192 regression tests, clean `tsc --noEmit`); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-187..193 all remain resolved; the Stage 2 closeout audit (2026-09-16, Sonnet 5 High)
found three neighbouring, unrelated defects while verifying the resolved fixes and opened
AFLDB-ISSUE-194..196. AFLDB-ISSUE-196 resolved 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5 High, from the approved
runbook — one runbook correction to the `across` regression contract mid-implementation, see
`issues.md` — operator-validated: 389/389 `nl-parser.test.ts`, 167/167 `nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts`,
clean `tsc --noEmit`). AFLDB-ISSUE-195 resolved 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5 High, from the approved runbook
`AFLDB-ISSUE-195.md`, Option B — subject-gated "won the/a premiership" vocabulary plus a narrow
club-season ownership guard, no runbook correction needed — operator-validated: 398/398
`nl-parser.test.ts`, 167/167 `nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts`, clean `tsc --noEmit`); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-194 resolved 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5 Medium, `sonnet/issue-194-team-match-symmetric-matchup`,
unmerged — operator-validated: 34/34 `tests/integration/nl-answers-team-club.test.ts`, clean
`tsc --noEmit`); see `issues.md`. AFLDB-ISSUE-187..196 all now resolved. The Stage 2 corpus triage
of the 208 `AMBIGUITY_NOT_DETECTED` rows (2026-09-16) classified 40 as `GENUINE_FAIL_OPEN`, 168 as
`STALE_CORPUS_EXPECTATION`, and opened AFLDB-ISSUE-197 for the 40 (one root cause).
**AFLDB-ISSUE-197 resolved 2026-09-16** (Sonnet 5, from the approved runbook `AFLDB-ISSUE-197.md` —
Option C, a dedicated `resolvePlayerFamily` resolver mirroring the parser's whole-word-prefix
predicate in SQL; `PARSER_VERSION` 48 → 49; operator-validated: 25/25
`tests/integration/nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts`, 951/951 across the full focused NL suite set,
clean `tsc --noEmit` — see `issues.md` for the full Implementation/Validation/Resolution record,
including one mid-session fixture correction and one integration-path control-flow investigation
that concluded fixture defect, not production defect). AFLDB-ISSUE-187..197 all now resolved.

Stage 2 status: **blocked again, narrowly.** ISSUE-197 resolving its one genuine fail-open root
cause cleared six of the seven generic-surname families (Johnson, Brown, Smith, Williams, Wilson,
Anderson). The v49 regression rerun (2026-09-16) found the seventh, Jones (rows 11626-11630,
5 rows), still hard-failing for a distinct-but-related reason: the parser's own defence-in-depth
`candidateNameWords` re-check does not tokenise hyphenated surnames (`Darcy Byrne-Jones`,
`David Rhys-Jones`) the same way SQL's `afldb_normalise_name` does, undercounting the real 13-member
Jones family to 11 and ranking a wrong answer instead of declining. **AFLDB-ISSUE-198 opened
2026-09-16, resolved 2026-09-16** (Sonnet 5, from the approved runbook `AFLDB-ISSUE-198.md` — one
implementation-time deviation from its §5 Option C code sketch, found empirically: `candidatePlayerSpan`
widens its acceptance test via the new shared `splitNameWords` helper but keeps the original
punctuation-bearing token, rather than exploding it, to stay aligned with the confidence/leftover-token
accounting elsewhere in the parser — see `issues.md`'s Implementation section). `PARSER_VERSION` 49 →
50. Operator-validated 2026-09-16: `tests/integration/nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts` 29/29 (DB-backed,
`afldb_test`), combined focused suite 964/964 across 6 files (`nl-parser.test.ts` 413/413,
`nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts` 167/167, `nl-regression-corpus.test.ts` 163/163,
`nl-audit-acceptance.test.ts` 10/10, `nl-plan.test.ts` 182/182, plus the integration file above),
clean `tsc --noEmit`. AFLDB-ISSUE-187..198 all now resolved.

The unchanged V1 12k-row corpus re-run on parser v50 (post-merge Stage 2 step) has now been run: hard
failures 178 -> 173, confirmed to be exactly the five Jones rows (11626-11630) clearing with zero
collateral movement. **AFLDB-ISSUE-199 resolved 2026-09-16** (Sonnet 5, from the approved runbook
`AFLDB-ISSUE-199.md`, revised mid-implementation after two real-DEV validation failures — see
`issues.md`'s Implementation/Final-patch-revision sections — a self-verifying correction script,
`tools/nl/fix-issue-199-stale-expectations.ts`, corrected exactly the 173 stale-decline rows; operator-
validated: correction-tool summary 173/173 targets modified, 0 non-target rows touched, plus a parser-v50
`nl:stress` re-run showing `AMBIGUITY_NOT_DETECTED`/hard-fail 173 -> 0 with the three soft classes
unchanged at 72/921/70; DB-free unit suite 28/28; `PARSER_VERSION` unchanged at 50). AFLDB-ISSUE-187..199
all now resolved. Stage 2 is **not** closed by this: the three soft classes remain open and unaudited
(item 4 below), and the rest of the Stage 2 closeout sequence remains outstanding.

**AFLDB-ISSUE-200 opened 2026-09-16, resolved 2026-09-16** (all Sonnet 5) for item 4's soft-class
audit. Runbook `AFLDB-ISSUE-200.md` written (planning); `tools/nl/audit-issue-200-extract.ts` and
`tools/nl/audit-issue-200-cluster.ts` (plus a shared constants module) written with DB-free unit
tests (implementation); the operator ran both scripts against the real
`/home/arm/nl-stress-v50-cleaned/` artifacts and found exactly six auto-clusters covering all 1,063
rows, and evidence-backed dispositions for all six were recorded in a checked-in mapping
(`tools/nl/issue-200-dispositions.csv`); **operator-validated resolution:** the final
`audit-issue-200-cluster.ts --apply-dispositions` run against the real
`/home/arm/issue-200-soft-audit.csv` reconciled exactly -- 1063 rows in, 1063 classified, 0
unmapped, 0 stale, `PLANNER_VALIDATOR_BUG` 598 / `STALE_CORPUS_EXPECTATION` 180 / `PARSER_BUG` 143 /
`GRAIN_EQUIVALENT_LEGITIMATE` 72 / `TAXONOMY_DRIFT` 70; local `tsc --noEmit` clean,
37/37 DB-free tests passed. No parser/planner/scorer code changed; neither external corpus file
modified. The three candidate defect follow-ons and the one guarded corpus-correction task (named in
`issues.md`) are recorded but not opened as tracked issues in this closeout.

**AFLDB-ISSUE-201 opened 2026-09-16, resolved 2026-09-16** (all Sonnet 5) for the first of those
follow-ons: the `PLANNER_VALIDATOR_BUG` `coverage_unavailable|boundary` cluster (598 rows).
`validatePlan` now exempts a `raw.boundary` plan from the career season-range rejection;
`player-career.ts` compiles the range against `c.debut_season`/`c.final_season`; `PARSER_VERSION`
50 → 51. Operator-validated: 774/774 focused unit tests, 33/33
`tests/integration/nl-answers.test.ts`, clean `tsc --noEmit`; stable-corpus rerun cleared 596 of the
598 rows, and the remaining 2 (id 9907, id 10294 — both "... Grand Final before 1897", `seasonMax`
genuinely one season before `NL_LIMITS.minSeason`) were confirmed stale corpus expectations, not
implementation defects, and corrected by a new guarded, self-verifying script,
`tools/nl/fix-issue-201-stale-boundary-expectations.ts` (17/17 unit tests passed). Final stable-corpus
result: 12,000 scored / 11,535 clean / 465 soft / 0 failed, with an independent diff confirming zero
collateral movement anywhere else in the corpus. See `issues.md` and `AFLDB-ISSUE-201.md` for the full
record. AFLDB-ISSUE-187..201 all now resolved.

Full entries, evidence, root causes and acceptance criteria are in `issues.md`.

## Stage 2 next task

1. **Done** (2026-09-16) — V1 regression corpus re-run against parser v49 (parse-only): hard
   failures 208 -> 178.
2. **Done** (2026-09-16) — fresh run's semantic rows compared against the retained v48 baseline:
   1271 -> 1241 non-clean rows, 30 rows became clean, 0 new non-clean rows, 0
   changed-but-still-non-clean rows. This comparison is what surfaced the Jones rows (§ above,
   AFLDB-ISSUE-198) as still-hard rather than clean.
3. **Done, resolved 2026-09-16** — the V1 12k corpus was re-run on parser v50: hard failures 178 ->
   173 (only the five Jones rows, 11626-11630, moved; confirmed clean via full semantic diff, zero
   collateral movement). The remaining 173 hard failures (5 Ablett + 112 team-streak + 56 coach-record)
   were all stale expected-decline rows predating shipped features. **AFLDB-ISSUE-199 resolved
   2026-09-16** — corrected via a checked-in, self-verifying script
   (`tools/nl/fix-issue-199-stale-expectations.ts`), operator-run against the real canonical CSV
   (`~/nl-stress-corpus.csv` on the dev host, which has no in-repo generator); `AMBIGUITY_NOT_DETECTED`
   173 -> 0, the three soft classes unchanged. See `issues.md` for full evidence.
4. **Done, resolved 2026-09-16 — AFLDB-ISSUE-200.** All 1,063 soft rows (`GRAIN_EQUIVALENT` 72,
   `UNEXPECTED_DECLINE` 921, `WRONG_FAILURE_REASON` 70) are classified into exactly six real
   clusters, operator-confirmed via the tool's own final `--apply-dispositions` run:
   `PLANNER_VALIDATOR_BUG` 598, `STALE_CORPUS_EXPECTATION` 180, `PARSER_BUG` 143,
   `GRAIN_EQUIVALENT_LEGITIMATE` 72, `TAXONOMY_DRIFT` 70 — no
   `intentional_conservative_decline`/`scorer_harness_artifact`/`duplicate_manifestation` clusters
   turned up in the real data. See `issues.md` for full evidence. Runbook: `AFLDB-ISSUE-200.md`.
5. **(a) done, resolved 2026-09-16 — AFLDB-ISSUE-201.** **(b) done, resolved 2026-09-16 —
   AFLDB-ISSUE-202**: a `PARSER_BUG` fix for "GWS"/"GWS Giants" leaking into unsupported-term
   detection on `team_match` margin questions (128 manifestations). Root cause was a missing
   combined alias (see `issues.md`/`AFLDB-ISSUE-202.md`); fix applied was the one-line
   `CLUB_NICKNAMES` addition, operator-validated against the retained V3 corpus (465 → 265 soft).
   The same fix also normalized all 72 `GRAIN_EQUIVALENT_LEGITIMATE` rows (GWS Giants player-season
   leading-goalkicker questions) to exact expected semantics as a byproduct, so that class is now 0.
   Stage 2 is **not yet** closed: **(c) opened 2026-09-16 as AFLDB-ISSUE-203, resolved 2026-09-16**
   (`PARSER_BUG` fix for the word "zero" not binding as numeric-zero in career conditions, 15
   manifestations, operator-validated, `PARSER_VERSION` 52→53); **(d) opened 2026-09-16 as
   AFLDB-ISSUE-204** (guarded corpus correction for the 180 `coverage_unavailable|fgf`
   disposals/marks/tackles finals/Grand Final rows currently asserting a stale
   `expected_status=success` — two coverage floors, not one: disposals/marks before 1965, tackles
   before 1987 — retargeted same-day after the first operator run failed closed on an over-broad
   996-row selector, pending operator re-validation). The 70 `TAXONOMY_DRIFT` rows are accepted diagnostic drift, not
   a correctness blocker, unless a later diagnostic-taxonomy cleanup is deliberately opened. Only after
   (d) resolves is the fresh exploratory Codex corpus sweep in scope, per the original Stage 2
   boundary.

Completed issue runbooks and supporting evidence are archived under `issues/closed/`.
