AFLDB-ISSUE-187..192 were opened 2026-09-15 from the Fable NL Search Stage 1 review (Fable 5.1,
medium effort), re-verified by Stage 2 on main `8a0c4cb`. Subsystem: natural-language search
(`src/search/nl/`, `src/db/queries/nl/`). AFLDB-ISSUE-190 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5);
AFLDB-ISSUE-188 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5); AFLDB-ISSUE-187 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5);
AFLDB-ISSUE-189 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5, from the approved runbook, operator-validated);
AFLDB-ISSUE-191 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5, operator-validated); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-193 (opened 2026-09-15 during ISSUE-189 planning) resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5,
operator-validated); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-192 resolved 2026-09-15 (Sonnet 5, operator-validated: 31/31 integration tests,
5/5 ISSUE-192 regression tests, clean `tsc --noEmit`); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-187..193 all remain resolved; the Stage 2 closeout audit (2026-09-16, Sonnet 5 High)
found three neighbouring, unrelated defects while verifying the resolved fixes and opened
AFLDB-ISSUE-194..196. AFLDB-ISSUE-196 resolved 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5 High, from the approved
runbook — one runbook correction to the `across` regression contract mid-implementation, see
`issues.md` — operator-validated: 389/389 `nl-parser.test.ts`, 167/167 `nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts`,
clean `tsc --noEmit`). AFLDB-ISSUE-195 resolved 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5 High, from the approved runbook
`AFLDB-ISSUE-195.md`, Option B — subject-gated "won the/a premiership" vocabulary plus a narrow
club-season ownership guard, no runbook correction needed — operator-validated: 398/398
`nl-parser.test.ts`, 167/167 `nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts`, clean `tsc --noEmit`); see `issues.md`.
AFLDB-ISSUE-194 resolved 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5 Medium, `sonnet/issue-194-team-match-symmetric-matchup`,
unmerged — operator-validated: 34/34 `tests/integration/nl-answers-team-club.test.ts`, clean
`tsc --noEmit`); see `issues.md`. AFLDB-ISSUE-187..196 all now resolved. The Stage 2 corpus triage
of the 208 `AMBIGUITY_NOT_DETECTED` rows (2026-09-16) classified 40 as `GENUINE_FAIL_OPEN`, 168 as
`STALE_CORPUS_EXPECTATION`, and opened AFLDB-ISSUE-197 for the 40 (one root cause).
**AFLDB-ISSUE-197 resolved 2026-09-16** (Sonnet 5, from the approved runbook `AFLDB-ISSUE-197.md` —
Option C, a dedicated `resolvePlayerFamily` resolver mirroring the parser's whole-word-prefix
predicate in SQL; `PARSER_VERSION` 48 → 49; operator-validated: 25/25
`tests/integration/nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts`, 951/951 across the full focused NL suite set,
clean `tsc --noEmit` — see `issues.md` for the full Implementation/Validation/Resolution record,
including one mid-session fixture correction and one integration-path control-flow investigation
that concluded fixture defect, not production defect). AFLDB-ISSUE-187..197 all now resolved.

Stage 2 status: **blocked again, narrowly.** ISSUE-197 resolving its one genuine fail-open root
cause cleared six of the seven generic-surname families (Johnson, Brown, Smith, Williams, Wilson,
Anderson). The v49 regression rerun (2026-09-16) found the seventh, Jones (rows 11626-11630,
5 rows), still hard-failing for a distinct-but-related reason: the parser's own defence-in-depth
`candidateNameWords` re-check does not tokenise hyphenated surnames (`Darcy Byrne-Jones`,
`David Rhys-Jones`) the same way SQL's `afldb_normalise_name` does, undercounting the real 13-member
Jones family to 11 and ranking a wrong answer instead of declining. **AFLDB-ISSUE-198 opened
2026-09-16, resolved 2026-09-16** (Sonnet 5, from the approved runbook `AFLDB-ISSUE-198.md` — one
implementation-time deviation from its §5 Option C code sketch, found empirically: `candidatePlayerSpan`
widens its acceptance test via the new shared `splitNameWords` helper but keeps the original
punctuation-bearing token, rather than exploding it, to stay aligned with the confidence/leftover-token
accounting elsewhere in the parser — see `issues.md`'s Implementation section). `PARSER_VERSION` 49 →
50. Operator-validated 2026-09-16: `tests/integration/nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts` 29/29 (DB-backed,
`afldb_test`), combined focused suite 964/964 across 6 files (`nl-parser.test.ts` 413/413,
`nl-semantic-mapping.test.ts` 167/167, `nl-regression-corpus.test.ts` 163/163,
`nl-audit-acceptance.test.ts` 10/10, `nl-plan.test.ts` 182/182, plus the integration file above),
clean `tsc --noEmit`. AFLDB-ISSUE-187..198 all now resolved.

The unchanged V1 12k-row corpus re-run on parser v50 (post-merge Stage 2 step) has now been run: hard
failures 178 -> 173, confirmed to be exactly the five Jones rows (11626-11630) clearing with zero
collateral movement. **AFLDB-ISSUE-199 resolved 2026-09-16** (Sonnet 5, from the approved runbook
`AFLDB-ISSUE-199.md`, revised mid-implementation after two real-DEV validation failures — see
`issues.md`'s Implementation/Final-patch-revision sections — a self-verifying correction script,
`tools/nl/fix-issue-199-stale-expectations.ts`, corrected exactly the 173 stale-decline rows; operator-
validated: correction-tool summary 173/173 targets modified, 0 non-target rows touched, plus a parser-v50
`nl:stress` re-run showing `AMBIGUITY_NOT_DETECTED`/hard-fail 173 -> 0 with the three soft classes
unchanged at 72/921/70; DB-free unit suite 28/28; `PARSER_VERSION` unchanged at 50). AFLDB-ISSUE-187..199
all now resolved. Stage 2 is **not** closed by this: the three soft classes remain open and unaudited
(item 4 below), and the rest of the Stage 2 closeout sequence remains outstanding.

**AFLDB-ISSUE-200 opened 2026-09-16** (planning only, Sonnet 5) for item 4's soft-class audit. Runbook
`AFLDB-ISSUE-200.md` written; classification schema, audit tooling proposal, and a finding that
`failures.csv` lacks the `expected_*` fields this audit needs (use `results.jsonl` instead) are all
recorded there. **Implementation session, 2026-09-16 (Sonnet 5):** `tools/nl/audit-issue-200-extract.ts`
and `tools/nl/audit-issue-200-cluster.ts` (plus a shared constants module) are now written, with
DB-free unit tests against synthetic fixtures (`tests/nl-issue-200-audit-extract.test.ts`,
`tests/nl-issue-200-audit-cluster.test.ts`). No parser/planner/scorer code changed; no DEV commands
run this session either (still no DEV file access from Windows), and `npm run typecheck`/the new
tests have not yet been executed by any session -- see `issues.md` for the exact commands. Next: an
operator/session with DEV file access runs the two scripts against `/home/arm/nl-stress-v50-cleaned/`
and performs the actual 1,063-row cluster classification per the runbook.

Full entries, evidence, root causes and acceptance criteria are in `issues.md`.

## Stage 2 next task

1. **Done** (2026-09-16) — V1 regression corpus re-run against parser v49 (parse-only): hard
   failures 208 -> 178.
2. **Done** (2026-09-16) — fresh run's semantic rows compared against the retained v48 baseline:
   1271 -> 1241 non-clean rows, 30 rows became clean, 0 new non-clean rows, 0
   changed-but-still-non-clean rows. This comparison is what surfaced the Jones rows (§ above,
   AFLDB-ISSUE-198) as still-hard rather than clean.
3. **Done, resolved 2026-09-16** — the V1 12k corpus was re-run on parser v50: hard failures 178 ->
   173 (only the five Jones rows, 11626-11630, moved; confirmed clean via full semantic diff, zero
   collateral movement). The remaining 173 hard failures (5 Ablett + 112 team-streak + 56 coach-record)
   were all stale expected-decline rows predating shipped features. **AFLDB-ISSUE-199 resolved
   2026-09-16** — corrected via a checked-in, self-verifying script
   (`tools/nl/fix-issue-199-stale-expectations.ts`), operator-run against the real canonical CSV
   (`~/nl-stress-corpus.csv` on the dev host, which has no in-repo generator); `AMBIGUITY_NOT_DETECTED`
   173 -> 0, the three soft classes unchanged. See `issues.md` for full evidence.
4. **In progress — AFLDB-ISSUE-200** (opened 2026-09-16, planning done, audit tooling implemented
   and unit-tested 2026-09-16, DEV run not started). Audit and classify all 1,063 soft rows
   (`GRAIN_EQUIVALENT` 72, `UNEXPECTED_DECLINE` 921, `WRONG_FAILURE_REASON` 70) into
   stale-expectation / genuine-defect / intentional-decline / taxonomy-drift / scorer-artifact /
   duplicate-manifestation clusters before deciding what, if anything, needs fixing. Not the same
   task as the fresh exploratory Codex corpus sweep, which remains a separate, later Stage 2 phase
   gated on this audit's genuine-defect follow-ons and any justified corpus corrections landing
   first. Runbook: `AFLDB-ISSUE-200.md`.

Completed issue runbooks and supporting evidence are archived under `issues/closed/`.
