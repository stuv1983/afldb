# Usage: phaneslight new-file <module> <path> "<description of at least five words>"
# <module> may be a source module, tests, or docs. Header selection is by DESTINATION, not by the
# module token (v3.6.1): any .md target resolving under the configured docRoot gets the DOC
# DISCIPLINE header and triggers a doc-index regeneration, whatever module was named, and the
# promotion is printed rather than applied silently. Everything else gets the module stamp in the
# project's comment syntax (read from .phaneslight/config.json). Refuses a missing or too-short
# description.
