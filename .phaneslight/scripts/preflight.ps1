#   2. Whitespace-only, literal null, bare-array and bare-string contents all PARSE cleanly, so
#      the catch never fires either, and the caller then reads a member off a value that has
#      none and silently gets $null.
# RequireMember closes (2) for a caller that knows its shape: pass 'artifacts' and a parsed
# value that is not an object carrying that member is 'malformed' rather than 'ok'.

# The loose root, for preflight and preflight only: the one command that must also run against
# a project PhanesLight has NOT bootstrapped yet, where no .phaneslight/config.json exists. Strict root
# first, then a BOUNDED walk for a .claude directory, then the current directory.
#
# The walk is bounded because the unbounded version was the worst single defect in this set: it
# walked up into the user profile and censused the whole machine as the project, reporting 6
# project commands and 12 CLAUDE.md files on an EMPTY fixture. The draft's fix excluded one
# literal string, $env:USERPROFILE, and SKIPPED that rung rather than stopping at it, and it
# did not hold. Review reproduced the original signature three separate ways: a subst drive
# aliasing the profile, USERPROFILE unset, and a second .claude sitting above the excluded
# profile. Worse, on this machine that fix held by ACCIDENT OF DIRECTORY LAYOUT rather than by
# construction, because the ladder above the profile happens to contain no .claude today.
#
# Four stop conditions replace the one exclusion, each tied to a reproduced or measured case:
#   1. .git in this directory   Stop after testing this level. Never walk out of a repository
#                               into its parent. This is also what protects a fresh project
#                               sitting under a directory that has grown its own .claude:
#                               there is no C:\Projects\.claude on this machine today, and a
#                               single mkdir would otherwise make twelve sibling projects
#                               census as one.
#   2. the home directory       Stop. Resolved by identity through three candidates, not by
#                               comparing one environment string that can be unset or spelled
#                               differently from the walk's own spelling.
#   3. no parent                A drive root and a UNC share root are never project roots, and
#                               this is refused WITHOUT testing the directory, which is what
#                               closes the subst case without P/Invoking
#                               GetFinalPathNameByHandle: R: mapped onto the profile is reached
#                               as a drive root and refused there. Note carefully that the
#                               refusal only works because it is evaluated before the accept.
#                               R:\ genuinely does carry a .claude (it IS the profile), so a
#                               no-parent check placed after the accept never runs.
