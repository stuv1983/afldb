# phaneslight-template v3.7.2 scaffold
# Mechanizes Phase 2.5 Steps 1, 1b, and 2: creates the documentation tree (under the
# configured docRoot), the tests tree, and the four verbatim README files, reading the README
# bodies from the installed prompt templates (.claude/template/readme-docs.md and
# readme-tests.md, SECTION blocks). Merge-never-overwrite: an EXISTING file or folder is never
# touched, only absent ones are created, and every creation is listed on stdout. CLAUDE.md and
# CLAUDE.local.md are deliberately NOT scaffold's to create: their blocks carry per-project
# judgment (Pinned Directives, capability register) and the session remains their writer.
# NOT advisory: exit 0 on success (including "nothing to do"); exit 1 when the project, config,
# or a required template cannot be read, or when a write fails (the session then falls back to
# writing the Step 1/1b/2 content from phaneslight.md directly). On a write failure the items already
# created ARE listed before the error: "nothing created" is achievable for every pre-write
# refusal and is NOT achievable once the eighth of nineteen writes fails, so the contract states
# what the script can actually guarantee rather than a promise it would break in silence.

# 'absent' and 'unreadable' are DIFFERENT ANSWERS, and conflating them is the fabricated empty
# set the Global Constraints ban outright. Two separate mechanisms produced that conflation in
# the draft and both are closed here:
#   1. Get-Content -Raw on a 0-byte file emits $null, so the pipeline never reaches
#      ConvertFrom-Json and the catch never fires. A 0-byte file is the canonical interrupted-
#      write corruption, which makes it the single most likely real-world case and exactly the
#      one the guard missed.
#   2. Whitespace-only, literal null, bare-array and bare-string contents all PARSE cleanly, so
#      the catch never fires either, and the caller then reads a member off a value that has
#      none and silently gets $null.
# RequireMember closes (2) for a caller that knows its shape: pass 'artifacts' and a parsed
# value that is not an object carrying that member is 'malformed' rather than 'ok'.
#
# The result hashtable is a bare @{} on purpose: its keys are three fixed literals, never user
# content, so the Ordinal rule does not apply to it.
