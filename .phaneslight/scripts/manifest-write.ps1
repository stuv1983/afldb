#   2. Whitespace-only, literal null, bare-array and bare-string contents all PARSE cleanly, so
#      the catch never fires either, and the caller then reads a member off a value that has
#      none and silently gets $null.
# RequireMember closes (2) for a caller that knows its shape: pass 'artifacts' and a parsed
# value that is not an object carrying that member is 'malformed' rather than 'ok'.
