# breach state, manifest sha256 drift, module-list vs config, optional spec-version compare)
# and the git delta, and emits ONE JSON verdict {sensors, quiet, gitDelta}. quiet is true only
# on POSITIVE evidence of stasis: a sensor that cannot observe reports available:false and the
# verdict is NOT quiet, because unknown is not quiet. gitDelta is separate from quiet by
# contract: the session requires quiet AND gitDelta.available AND an empty changedFiles before
# taking the fast path. hook-verify folds in here: `update-preflight --hooks-only` prints just
# the hooks sensor (the standalone hook-verify form; same logic, one implementation).
# Optional: --spec-version <v> compares the RUNNING spec's version against the installed one;
# without it that sensor is reported not-provided and excluded from quiet (Step 0's own
# self-version check already covers it and is never skipped). Advisory: always exits 0.

#      write corruption, which makes it the single most likely real-world case and exactly the
#      one the guard missed.
#   2. Whitespace-only, literal null, bare-array and bare-string contents all PARSE cleanly, so
#      the catch never fires either, and the caller then reads a member off a value that has
#      none and silently gets $null.
# RequireMember closes (2) for a caller that knows its shape: pass 'artifacts' and a parsed
# value that is not an object carrying that member is 'malformed' rather than 'ok'.

# template at the moment it decides to preserve. What this can honestly report is the INVENTORY:
# which files are customized, and whether each one even has a baseline to be compared against
# later. A pre-v3.4 manifest carries no templateSha256, so those entries report
# templateSha256Known false and are counted as UNKNOWN, never as fresh and never as stale.
# This is degrade-never-fabricate applied to a new sensor, which matters given how much of the
# review that produced it was about sensors inventing answers.
#
# Deliberately NOT an input to `quiet`, and the reason is worth stating because it looks like an
# omission. UNKNOWN is the normal, permanent state for every project installed before v3.4, so
# feeding it into quiet would make those projects non-quiet forever and destroy the fast path
# this whole workstream exists to build. This sensor informs; it does not gate.
